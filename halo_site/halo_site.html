            <h2>Events leading up to the Human Covenant War </h2>
            <p>The setting of Halo takes place 500 years in the future when humanity
                has become largely united forming the UNSC United Nations Space Command, has formed colonies on
                other worlds, and
                figured out how to travel faster than light. During this time they had to deal with various
                rebellions and
                uprisings. Because of this ONI ake the Office of Naval Intelligence started the Spartan Program to
                ensure that the UNSC and its colonies would remain
                stable. This was done by sending out operatives into the field to kidnap various children who met
                the
                requirements. They were then taken to the planet Reach where they would be trained and
                indoctrinated. Years later
                they would be given augmentations to increase their reflexes, speed, and strength. They would be
                equipped with
                Mjolner power armor which would further augment their speed and strength, as well as give them the
                ability to
                interface with ai. In the year 2525 a Covenant ship crewed by Jackals would raid an UNSC vessel. At
                this time
                humans had no evidence of intelligent alien life and just found numerous planets with animals so
                nobody thought it
                was aliens. They just thought it was rebels or pirates. Later they hid some troops onboard a ship
                that acted as
                bait and encountered the aliens. They would later make contact with another ship headed by Brutes
                and meet at the
                planet Harvest to form a trade agreement/peace treaty. The Covenant used a device called a Luminary
                that detected Forerunner artifacts and found the human colony was covered with relics. A battle
                broke out when a Grunt accidentally attacked a human soldier. There was then an extended engagement
                of Harvest between the Covenant detachment and the humans on the planet. Back at the mobile
                fortress/home world High Charity the three who would later become the prophets of Truth, Mercy and
                Regret asked this ancient Forerunner ai Mendicant Bias about the artifacts that had the glyph
                reclamation. The ai told them they were grossly misunderstanding and turned the glyph upside down
                where it then said reclaimer. Reclaimer was the Forerunner symbol for humanity and meant that their
                descendants would reclaim all the lost technology after life was reseeded following the Rings being
                fired to stop the Flood. They also learned that not everyone who believed in their faith would be
                saved by the Halos firing, and that some were left behind. Upon realizing that their faith was a lie
                and that humanity were the descendants/inheritors of the Forerunner’s legacy they declared a war of
                extermination to wipe this newly discovered species out. This would preserve their political power
                and keep the masses inline preventing the dissolvement of the Covenant. Thus beginning the
                Human-Covenant War. Later additions to the lore would contradict this by making Forerunners and
                humans two different species in this very convoluted book trilogy.</p>

        <h4>Major events of the war and the parties involved </h4>
        <p>The first major battle of the war would be the attack on Harvest that was previously mentioned. The UNSC
            was able to delay this new alien force just long enough to get most of the population off world.
            Eventually the Covenant would just fire superheated plasma from their ships that turned the surface into
            volcanic glass. The Covenant almost never landed troops on the ground unless they had a really good
            reason. In ground engagements the UNSC were able to hold their own and do a lot of damage to the
            Covenant ground forces. Space was an entirely different matter because the Covenant ships had shields,
            plasma torpedoes that would home in on their targets melting through the ship’s hull, and greatly
            outnumbered the human ships. Whenever they’d show up it wasn’t a question of “how do we win?”, it was
            always “how do we delay the Covenant for long enough to get enough of the population off world before
            they destroy everything?”. Since the Covenant’s goal was extermination and could just terraform the
            plants later they would just glass them and move on to the next one. This brutal campaign went on for 28
            years with only earth remaining as the last human population center. Since the Luminaries would detect
            Forerunner relics and viewed humans as Forerunner relics, they would be able to detect human planets.
            During this time a man by the name of Preston Cole who was the Vice Admiral was given control of the
            largest human fleet to combat the new alien threat. Under his leadership they were able to take back
            Harvest in 2526, and engaged the Covenant around the outer colonies for about 5 years. The Covenant then
            returned to Harvest resulting in a brutal 5 year conflict that ended with humans taking back the planet.
            Around this time the Covenant’s leadership realized that devoting their fleets to this war of
            extermination would leave them vulnerable to a potential attack from any unknown alien powers/species.
            In 2552 the Covenant’s solution was to use Forerunner technology to build a new fleet that they could
            use to win the war fast. This kicks off the events of the rts Halo Wars 1 where the Spirit of Fire and
            it’s crew would investigate a Forerunner structure that the Covenant took interest in. This contained a
            star chart that would lead the Covenant to the human colony Arcadia. At the time there was an Arbiter
            who captured a human scientist because she was able to use Forerunner technology and they would be able
            to use her to activate their prize. The Spirit of Fire chased the Covenant to a shield world that was a
            Flood infection on it’s surface. Eventually the planet opened up and brought the Spirit of Fire inside.
            ONce inside they rescued the scientist and used their slipspace drive to detonate the shield world. This
            victory prevented humanity from being wiped out then and there. But it resulted in them being stranded
            in space. The crew then went into cryosleep until they were needed.
            By the year 2534 most of the outer colonies had been glassed by the Covenant. Some of these worlds
            included important agricultural and manufacturing worlds. Because of the problems caused by this the
            UNSC imposed all kinds of restrictions of travel, rationing out food, and other necessary precautions.
            This was to prevent more colonies from being discovered. The Insurrectionists not believing the Covenant
            were real or at least just thinking it was grossly exaggerated propaganda began to start fighting the
            UNSC more than they were before. These rebels sided with what they thought were Jackal renegades who
            were trading weapons with them. At the time the rebels were unaware of the fact that these modified
            weapons had tracking devices in them and the Jackals wanted to take the rebel hideout for themselves.
            The UNSC learned about this and were horrified because of the security risk, while the Elites were
            angered that this unholy species would dare modify their weapons. THis hideout was then destroyed.
            The years 2536-2551 would be referred to as the Siege of the Inner Colonies because the Covenant had
            finally pushed through into the most important sections of human space. Several important worlds would
            be destroyed with a few costly victories for the UNSC. One of these was referred to as Admiral Cole’s
            last stand where he lured 200 Covenant ships into a gas giant and detonated it with some nukes
            temporarily turning the planet into a star. He was assumed to be dead and is revered as a hero for his
            actions.
            In 2552 ONI devised the plan Operation Red Flag where they planned to locate the Covenant’s home world
            so they could capture a high prophet and force the Covenant to a truce. All of the Spartan 2s would be
            brought back to the planet Reach, which was the most important planet second only to earth. The Covenant
            would find this planet and began a siege that was very costly for both sides. At the time it was
            believed that all Spartans aside from Master Chief had died in the battle. As the planet was being
            destroyed, the human ship the Pillar of Autumn made a slipspace jump based on some alien coordinates and
            found a Halo Ring beginning the events of the first game.
            On the Ring since it was a holy relic that the Covenant believed would allow them to attain salvation
            they were unable to use their usual glassing tactics because that would destroy/damage the Ring. On the
            surface of the Ring the crew were able to do lots of damage to the Covenant through guerilla tactics.
            Eventually the Covenant accidentally released this fungal parasite called the Flood that had destroyed
            the Forerunners thousands of years ago. The Ring’s ai monitor led Chief to the control center and tried
            to get him to activate the Ring to destroy the Flood. Luckily the ai Cortana told Chief that the Rings
            kill all organic life in the area to starve the Flood. They then had to destroy the Ring by detonating
            the Autumn’s engines.
            In the second game after escaping with a group of marines Chief and the other survivors from the Ring
            were having an award ceremony right as a small Covenant fleet led by the Prophet of Regret appeared
            right outside of earth’s defenses. At the same time the Elite commander who was incharge of the fleet
            that followed them to the Ring was punished for his failure. Chief and everyone else would beat back the
            attack and they were about to board Regret’s ship to engage operation red flag. The ship jumped and so
            they followed him to another Halo. At the same time the Elite who was shamed was given the title Arbiter
            by the Prophet of Truth because he was still useful. He was then sent to wipe out some Elite heretics
            who learned the truth about the Rings. On the Ring Chief would kill Regret causing the Brutes to switch
            places with the Elites becoming the Prophet’s personal guards. This caused tensions to rise and
            eventually the Brutes would turn on the Elites causing the Great Schism. This would cause the Elites to
            side with humans out of desperation and because they learned the Rings would kill everyone. Chief would
            be on High Charity at the time and was chasing Truth and Mercy. The Flood had escaped and began
            infecting High Charity. The Arbiter and some humans would travel to earth and Chief would board Truth’s
            ship and travel to earth.
            In 3 the Covenant fleet had finally made their war to earth in search of the Ark. The Ark was the place
            where the Rings were built and could fire them all from there. By this time humans and Elites had formed
            an alliance and were working together against the Covenant. The Brutes had taken on new roles they
            hadn’t had before and were the new leaders of the Covenant military. A Flood infected ship made its way
            to earth and a group of Elite ships had chased it so the infection wouldn’t spread. The combined fleet
            then went through the portal that led to the Ark where they fought Truth’s forces. Eventually Truth was
            killed by the Arbiter effectively ending the war since the leadership was gone. Chief and the Arbiter
            would then escape and since Chief was in the back part of the ship that was cut off he was left drifting
            in space.
