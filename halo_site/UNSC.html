            <h1>UNSC History</h1>

            <p>The UNSC was formed in 2163 as a response to the resurgence of Fascist and Communist powers that were
                spreading into the solar system. There were a few wars that led to the UN using this organization as
                their military. At the time there was also the UIG United Earth Government which was formed by the UN
                absorbing all other nations for stability. WHen colonizing different worlds the different countries
                would send out ships to colonize these planets. Sometime before the Human-Covenant War there were
                rebellions here and there because the outer colonies didn’t have nearly as much say in what happened as
                the inner colonies did. The planets closer to earth had better industry, more power, and infrastructure.
                While the outer colonies mostly just mined resources and sent them back to the heart of human space.
                They felt they were unrepresented and wanted to control themselves or at least just have more industry
                and power. The Spartan 2 program would be formed as a way to put down these rebellions so they couldn’t
                threaten the power/stability of the inner colonies. When the Human-Covenant Wars broke out the colonial
                militia would be absorbed into the UNSC, and the organization would gain more power over what happened.
                Late into the war the UNSC was the government for humanity out of necessity.</p>

                    Misriah Armory. This and other side arms can be dual wielded. The thing fires a .50 calibre round
                    and has a magizine size of 8 bullets. This definitly sounds like overkill but when you consider the
                    fact that they're fighting enemeies that have regenerating shields and strong armor it's entirely
                    nessecary. Unfortunatly it's not nearly as useful in later games as it was in the first. It was in
                    Halos 1, 3, Reach, 4, and 5. Single shot weapons like this one will fill the role of a precision
                    weapon.</h4>

                <h4>Commonly referred to ingame and by the players as the SMG this weapon can be dual wielded and is
                    very effective at close range. In Halo 2 it acted as the replacement to the Assault Rifle and showed
                    off the new dual wielding feature Bungie added. The gun only appears in 2, 3, and would eventually
                    return in 5. In the games it has a crazy recoil causing your reticle to raise upwards. In universe
                    this wouldn't really make sense because being a super soldeir you can pick up and use machine gun
                    turrets, dual wield, and highjack vehicles. If it was like this in the lore normal humans would not
                    be able to use it. This is purely for the purposes of gameplay. The weapon fires 5x23mm caseless
                    rounds with a magizine size of 60 bullets.</h4>

                    bullets. It functions the replacement to the MA5B from the first game which fired 60 rounds per
                    magizine. Unfortunatly in terms of functionality it shares the same niche as the SMGs because it has
                    bad accuracy and does similar damage. Later games would decrees the projectile spread and bump the
                    magizine up to 36 rounds. The thing is a staple weapon from the Halo series, but you'll be better
                    off replacing it once you find something better.</h4>

                    weapons it can take out unshielded players/enemies with a headshot. The weapon fires a 3 round
                    burst, and in earlier builds of the game fired a single shot. The bullets used are 9.5x40mm with a
                    magizine size of 36. This is one of the weapons people will imedietly recognize from the games.</h4>

                <h2>M90 Shotgun</h2>
                <h4>The shotgun has changed quite a bit in terms of gameplay. In the first game it had really good range
                    and was super useful. From 2 onwards it followed the unfortunate trend in games where shotguns have
                    the effective range of a spear, and become useless due to an insane projectile spread. This is there
                    for balancing reasons because something that can kill in 1-2 shots would be too overpowered if it
                    was good at range. This weapon can hold 8 shells inside it and fires 8-gauge shells. Most other
                    weapons reload the entire magazine at once but this does one shell at a time. It is your best friend
                    when fighting the Flood because it tears them up and they'll charge you. Other than having glowing
                    lights on the sights it looks like something that could exist now.</h4>

                <h4>The sniper is one of the most effective weapons in the game being able to kill unshielded enemies in
                    one hit anywhere on their body. To balance this out the reticle is small and you don't get it very
                    often. In 1 it could fire all 4 shots pretty fast, but all games going forward would reduce the
                    firing speed. ANother thing that changed from the first game was the scope could use nightvision.
                    This thing is catagorized as an anti-personnel weapon firing out 14.114mm rounds and having for
                    shots per magazine.</h4>

                <h4>The Rocket Launcher can hold 2 102mm rockets per mag. In 2 and Reach the thing would lock onto
                    vehicles and fire a homing shot. For whatever reason the other games don't do this. Interestingly
                    this gun was used in Bungie's first fps Marathon and had the same design/function. This thing is
                    mainly used against vehicles but can also oneshot most normal enemies. If you're driving a vehicle
                    you will want to give this and other "power weapons" to your allies because they're a better shot
                    and have infinite ammo. It's really fun to have a bunch of guys all armed with great weapons and

                <h4>The Spartan Laser was first introduced in 3 and appeared in games Reach, ODST, 4, and 5. It
                    basically acts as an anti everything gun because when it charges up it will send out a beam that
                    oneshots most things. The full name for this weapon is the Weapon/Anti-Vehicle Model 6
                    Grindell/Galilean Nonlinear Rifle. it is the only energy weapon used by the USNC. Based on the name
                    you'd think that only Spartans would be able to use it. Normal marines and ODSTs can hold it. The
                    reason they call it the "Spartan Laser" is because it's super heavy and is so powerful. It has a
                    really good range and once the laser fires up it will instantly hit whatever it's pointing at.</h4>

                    uses the same 7.62x51mm ammo as the Assault Rifle. When the thing is mounted you can fire it never
                    runs out of ammo, but when you break it off it only carries 200 rounds. The reason for this is
                    because it shreds infantry and vehicles. If it never ran out or had a ammo count it would be too
                    over powered. The thing also reduces your walking speed to half because you're carrying something
                    heavy.</h4>

                    fire forever, but when not mounted it only holds 8 shots because it's so powerful. Usually you'll
                    see these mounted in defensive positions, and first encounter them on the level where you fight a
                    Scarab. These rockets are extremely useful against air vehicles.</h4>

                <h4>Introduced in 3, the flamethrower is a heavy weapon the slows you down when using it and roasts
                    everything it catches on fire. It can light the floor, objects, and walls on fire for a short time.
                    Also known as the M7057/Defoliant Projector this can be used to render bodies unusable for Flood
                    consumption and can burn back the infection from taking over other hosts. It carries 100 fuel and
                    can't be reloaded just like the other heavy weapons. In the first game you were suposed to get a
                    flamethrower but it was cut because the first game had an interesting development cycle where the
                    game changed radically throught development. There was suposed to be a Covenant flamethrower called

                    more than two granade types it's just two, and in others it's three of each. This was done for
                    balancing reasons. In the first game these things were super strong and would kill instantly. In

                    explosive shell. If you just pull the trigger the grenage will bounce and exploade, but if you hold
                    down the trigger it won't explode until you release it and will emp shields/vehicles in the area. It
