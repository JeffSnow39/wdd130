        [Welcome to Halo site (temporary name).  Here I will inform you about the major events of the Human Covenant War, the main factions involved, the weapons and vehicles both sides used, as well as the ideologies of both.  Here you will learn about the Spartan Program and other shady operations by ONI aka the Office of Naval Intelligence.  Here you will learn about what in universe groups produced the various weapons and vehicles you see in game, how they work, and their stats (damage, firing rate).  The setting of Halo takes place 500 years in the future when humanity has become largely united forming the UNSC United Nations Space Command, has formed colonies on other worlds, and figured out how to travel faster than light.  During this time they had to deal with various rebellions and uprisings.  Because of this ONI started the Spartan Program to ensure that the UNSC and its colonies would remain stable.  This was done by sending out operatives into the field to kidnap various children who met the requirements.  They were then taken to the planet Reach where they would be trained and indoctrinated.  Years later they would be given augmentations to increase their reflexes, speed, and strength.  They would be equipped with Mjolner power armor which would further augment their speed and strength, as well as give them the ability to interface with ai.  In the year 2525 a Covenant ship crewed by Jackals would raid an UNSC vessel.  At this time humans had no evidence of intelligent alien life and just found numerous planets with animals so nobody thought it was aliens.  They just thought it was rebels or pirates.  Later they hid some troops onboard a ship that acted as bait and encountered the aliens.  They would later make contact with another ship headed by Brutes and meet at the planet Harvest to form a trade agreement/peace treaty.  ]
