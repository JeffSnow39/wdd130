            <h2>Covenant History and Founding </h2>

            <p>The Covenant empire was founded in 852 BC after a long and brutal war between the Prophets and Elites.
                This war was started because the Prophets were reverse engineering Forerunner technology to advance
                themselves. The Elites on the other hand believed this was sacrilege because they believed the artifacts
                were sacred and should not be touched. The Elites had better warriors but the Prophets had better
                technology. Eventually a truce was formed and the Prophets would tell the Elites about the Great Journey
                which they believed would allow them to obtain godhood. After this the Writ of Union would be signed
                with the Prophets as the religious leaders and incharge of reverse engineering technology, and the
                ELites would be their personal guard/military. Eventually they would come across other races to bring
                into the Covenant. In 784 the Taming of the Hunters would occur when they realized this race of giant
                worms that were eating Forerunner relics could be controlled and put to use. Hunters are made up of a
                colony of worms that form together to create something of a hivemind. They can take on numerous
                different forms. In 1112 the Drones would be incorporated into the Covenant. The Drones are giant
                insects that are really good with machines, come from a high gravity world, and are incapable of feeling
                fear. The only reason they didn’t get wiped out was because the Covenant thought their home world
                contained Forerunner artifacts, but there weren’t any. In 1342 the Jackals would be incorporated into
                the Covenant. Prior to this point the Jackals were comprised of merchants, pirates, and other things.
                They would commonly fight amongst themselves, but when the Covenant showed up they gathered together all
                of their ships to form a defense. This only stalled the Covenant. The Jackals don’t really care much
                about the Covenant faith and are mostly just used as mercenaries and the pirates are given free reign to
                attack whatever isn’t aligned with the Covenant. Jackals have 3 subspecies and are a matriarchy. They
                are armed with a shield gauntlet that blocks gun fire and are commonly used as snipers because of their
                excellent vision and aim. In 2142 the Grunts would be incorporated into the Covenant. The Grunts wear
                these backpacks that contain methane which they need to breathe. Since methane is a flammable gas they
                essentially have a bomb strapped to their back that they need in order to not suffocate. These are the
                lowest rank in the Covenant and make up the bulk of their forces. There was a Grunt rebellion that shook
                the Covenant and was stopped by glassing portions of their planet to make them give up and deploying an
                Arbiter. In 2492 the Covenant discovered the Brutes and incorporated them into their ranks. The Covenant
                can best be described as a militaristic theocracy with a racial caste system. They crush any descent and
                will make an example out of you. The Covenant call the Spartan super soldiers demons because from their
                perspective Chief is a literal demon. In ODST they will call you an imp which is a lesser demon. That
                was a cool detail that enhances them.</p>

                <h2>Type-25 Direct Energy Pistol</h2>
                <h4>Normally referred to as the Plasma Pistol, this weapon is the most commonly used side arm for the
                    lesser Covenant species. The weapon fires as fast as you can pull the trigger, and if you hold down
                    the trigger it will fire a charged shot that can emp shields/vehicles. In 1-2 the Plasma Pistol
                    could hold the charged shot infinitely, but from 3 onwards it would start draining the battery as
                    you held it down. Just like all other energy weapons the gun doesn't reload, has a limited battery
                    and will need to be swapped out, and will overheat if fired for too long. In lore these things can
                    cause third-degree burns, melt through metal, and if you get shot in the chest this thing will burn
                    a hole right through you. The projectiles are green. In 2-3 they can be dual wielded.</h4>

                    high ranking lesser Covenant will have these. These guns will fire faster than the plasma pistol but
                    their drawback is that they overheat faster. When fired continueously it isn't that accurate, but
                    when fired in burst you can shoot faster and much more accurately. In 2-3 they can be dual wielded.

                    dangerous to anyone who is unarmored or unshielded. In 2 they could be dual wielded, but due to the
                    gun being buffed in 3 they can only can only be single wielded. In lore the Covenant don't even know
                    how these things work. Like most of their technology they've just reverse engineered Forerunner tech

                    particles that tear right through flesh causing third degree burns and can easily take out shields.
                    They will overheat if fired too frequently. They act as the Covenant's counterpart to the Sniper
                    Rifle. In 2 Jackals armed with these would oneshot you on Legendary diffuculty because that game was
                    super rushed and they didn't have time to properly fleshout the sandbox.</h4>

                    against vehicles or armor. Because of these drawbacks the weapon is rare and mainly just used by
                    Jackal snipers, Skirmishers, and Elites. </h4>

                <h2>Type-31 Needle Rifle</h2>
                <h4>Only appearing in Reach the Needle Rifle is a fast firing precision weapon that can exlode enemies
                    if enough needles hit their target. Unlike the Needler they don't track their target and just fire
                    in a straight line. They are used by Elites, Brutes, and Jackals. This is the Covenant equivlent to
                    the DMR, functions like the Carbine but with explosive rounds, and is very effective against
                    unshielded targets. In 5 there was a Carbine variant that was functionally identical to the Needle
                    Rifle firing out needles that explode. This is also used by the Jackal subspecies the "Skirmishers".

                <h4>The Brute Plasma Rifle has a faster firing rate than the normal Elite version, but it overheats
                    faster and has a less efficient battery. Only ever seen used by Brutes and one Drone rank. This
                    weapon has appeared in 2, ODST, and 5 as a multiplayer weapon variant. They have a red casing and
                    fire red plasma. They were given to the Brutes during their rise through the Covenant and the Great
