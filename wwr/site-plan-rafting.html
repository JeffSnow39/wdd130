    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>[Our goal at Dry Oar is to provide a safe place for people to come on the weekends or for their break and have a thrilling experience.  Safety is a big concern so we've taken various measures.  We also wish to educate people on the potential risks of rafting so they don't get hurt or drown.  Our buisiness model allows us to provide other activities out of season.  This will allow people who like outdoor activities to meet like minded people and enjoy their shared interests together.]</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>[Our target audience is thrill seaking teens and college students.  On the weekends this would allow them to get together and have fun riding the rapids in a controlled enviroment that's far safer than finding a river far from any potential rescue.  This would give them a productive activity for their weekends/breaks instead of getting into trouble.  The main way people would access the website would be on a laptop.  If people go in a group they'll get a discount, and a membership will be cheeper than having to pay every weekend.]</p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
